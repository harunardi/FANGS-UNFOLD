  abstract = {The paper presents CORE SIM+, a tool developed for diffusion-based neutron noise simulations. The simulator is based on the 3-dimensional, two-energy group neutron diffusion equation in the frequency domain. The tool includes the necessary solvers to calculate the criticality problems associated with the system and then the response to a variety of perturbations such as absorbers of variable strength, perturbations travelling with the coolant flow and vibrations of core components. Numerical methods suitable for different types of problems have been implemented. A capability that allows to apply nonuniform computational meshes is available so that the discretization of the domain can be optimized with respect to the characteristics of the neutron noise sources. The simulator can generate neutron noise databases for nuclear power reactors via the Green's function method in a fully automated manner. These databases can be useful when studying the neutron noise response in a reactor and when training machine learning algorithms for core monitoring and diagnostics. As part of the verification process, the CORE SIM+ response of a realistic reactor model to a given perturbation at various frequencies is used to estimate the corresponding point-kinetic component, compared to an exact analytical expression. In addition, the Green's function generator is used to calculate the response of a system to a fuel cell vibration. The solution is then compared to the one of the direct solver of CORE SIM+. As part of the validation work, a neutron noise experiment with vibrations of fuel rods is simulated, showing a reasonable agreement with the measurements. A representative neutron noise database generated for a generic pressurized water reactor is described. From the database the simulations of fuel assembly and core barrel vibrations are chosen as illustrative examples for demonstrating the capabilities of the tool.},

This has been important for modeling some of the smaller advanced reactor designs for which simplified approximations such as few groups homogenized diffusion theory are not as accurate as they were for large light water reactor cores. For narrow cylindrical cores with large surface to volume ratios such the Ped Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR), neutron leakage from the core can be significant, particularly with the harder neutron spectrum and longer mean free path than a light water reactor. In this paper the core from the OECD PBMR-400 benchmark was analyzed using multigroup Monte Carlo cross sections in the HTR reactor core simulation code AGREE. Homogenized cross sections were generated for each of the discrete regions of the AGREE model using a full core SERPENT Monte Carlo model. The cross sections were generated for a variety of group structures in AGREE to assess the importance of finer group discretization on the accuracy of the core eigenvalue and flux predictions compared to the SERPENT full core Monte Carlo solution. A significant increase in the accuracy was observed by increasing the number of energy groups, with as much as a 530 pcm improvement in the eigenvalue calculation when increasing the number of energy groups from 2 to 14. Significant improvements were also observed in the AGREE neutron flux distributions compared to the SERPENT full core calculation.},

One important aspect of CORTEX is the development of neutron noise simulation codes capable of modeling the spatial variations of the noise distribution in a reactor. In this paper we illustrate the validation activities concerning the comparison of the simulation results obtained by several noise simulation codes with respect to experimental data produced at the zero-power reactors AKR-2 (operated at TUD, Germany) and CROCUS (operated at EPFL, Switzerland). Both research reactors are modeled in the time and frequency domains, using transport or diffusion theory. Overall, the noise simulators managed to capture the main features of the neutron noise behavior observed in the experimental campaigns carried out in CROCUS and AKR-2, even though computational biases exist close to the region where the noise-inducing mechanical vibration was located (the so-called "noise source"). In some of the experiments, it was possible to observe the spatial variation of the relative neutron noise, even relatively far from the noise source. This was achieved through reduced uncertainties using long measurements, the installation of numerous, robust and efficient detectors at a variety of positions in the near vicinity or inside the core, as well as new post-processing methods.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the possibility of localising a noise source of the type ``absorber of variable strength'' (or reactor oscillator) from as few as five neutron detectors evenly distributed throughout the core of a commercial nuclear reactor. The novelty of this investigation lies with the fact that the calculations are performed for a realistic 2-D heterogeneous reactor in the 2-group diffusion approximation, via the prior determination of the corresponding reactor transfer function. It is first demonstrated that the response of such a reactor to a localized perturbation deviates significantly from point-kinetics. The space-dependence of the induced neutron noise thus carries enough information about the location of the noise source, which makes it possible to determine its position from a few detector readings. The identification of the type of noise source is easily performed from the in-phase behaviour of the induced neutron noise. Different unfolding techniques are finally tested. All these techniques rely on the use of the reactor transfer function. One of these techniques is based on the comparison between the actual measured neutron noise and the neutron noise calculated for every possible location of the noise source. This technique is very reliable and almost insensitive to the contamination of the detector signals by background noise, but also extremely CPU consuming. Another technique, based on the piece-wise inversion of the reactor transfer function and requiring little CPU effort, was developed. Although this technique is much less reliable when background noise is present, this technique is useful to indicate a region of the reactor where a noise source is likely to be located.},

In the first section, the neutron noise source is reconstructed using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in a typical VVER-1000 reactor core. In the first stage of this section, the neutron noise calculations are performed based on Galerkin Finite Element Method (GFEM). To this end, two types of noise sources including absorber of variable strength and vibrating absorber are considered. As the results of noise calculations, the neutron noise is obtained in the location of detectors. In the second stage, the multilayer perception neural network is developed for reconstruction of the noise source. Complex neutron noises (real and imaginary parts) in the location of detectors are considered as the inputs of ANN. The developed artificial neural network consists of two hidden layers of type hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function and a linear transfer function in the output layer. Noise source characteristics including strength, frequency and the location (X and Y coordinates) are identified with high accuracy. The developed hybrid method which comprises scanning method and multilayer perception neural network is employed for reconstruction of two coincidence noise sources. The number, type and location of noise source are exactly reconstructed using the hybrid method. The strength and frequency of noise source(s) are also identified with high accuracy using the developed method. A sensitivity analysis of the reconstructed noise source to some ANN parameters like the number of hidden layers, neurons in each hidden layer and the applied transfer functions is performed. Variation of accuracy of reconstructed noise source versus number of detectors and their arrangement in the reactor core are investigated as well.},

  abstract = {KWU pre-Konvoi PWRs (SIEMENS design) are commonly exhibiting high neutron noise levels which can lead to costly operational issues (i.e. activation of SCRAM system, operation of unrated core power, etc.). The frequency region of interest of neutron noise is below 1\,Hz, which is the typical frequency range of thermal-hydraulic phenomena. This feature seems to indicate that, coolant flow and temperature oscillations can have a key impact on neutron noise phenomena. Moreover, an increasing neutron noise trend (in term of normalized root mean square) was recently observed in many KWU-PWRs. This increasing trend has been speculated to be correlated with the introduction of a new fuel design type in the KWU-PWRs. This fact indicates that there should be some correlation between neutron noise spectral characteristics and fuel assemblies' performance. In order to advance in understanding this phenomenon, the transient nodal code SIMULATE-3K (S3K) has been used to simulate mechanical vibrations of fuel assemblies and thermal-hydraulic fluctuations of the core inlet flow and temperature. The simulated neutron detectors responses are analysed with noise analysis techniques and compared to real plant data. This analysis indicates that the cross-feedback between the mechanical and thermal-hydraulic disturbances complicate the identification of the origin of the perturbation source. The simulated results indicate that the neutron noise spectral characteristics can be associated separately to different causes. In this sense, the results of this work seem to indicate that the spectral features of the neutron noise are a consequence of both mechanical perturbations and thermal-hydraulic fluctuations.},

These developments have stimulated great interest in on-line monitoring (OLM) technologies and new diagnostic and prognostic methods to anticipate, identify, and resolve equipment and process problems and ensure plant safety, efficiency, and immunity to accidents. This paper provides examples of these technologies with particular emphasis on eight key OLM applications: detecting sensing-line blockages, testing the response time of pressure transmitters, monitoring the calibration of pressure transmitters on-line, cross-calibrating temperature sensors in situ, assessing equipment condition, performing predictive maintenance of reactor internals, monitoring fluid flow, and extending the life of neutron detectors. These applications are discussed in the following sections. Emphasis is placed on the principles of a core OLM method -- noise analysis -- and the technical requirements for an integrated OLM system are summarized.},

An efficient prime factor algorithm to compute the fast Fourier transform allows the continuous, real-time comparison of the normalized power spectrum density function of the signal against previously stored reference patterns in a continuously evolving matrix. The monitoring system has been successfully tested offline. Four examples of the application of the monitoring system to the detection and diagnostic of faulty equipment behavior are presented in this work: the detection of two different events of partial blockage at the jet pump inlet nozzle, miss-calibration of a recirculation mass flow sensor, and detection of a faulty data acquisition card. The events occurred at the two BWR Units of the Laguna Verde Nuclear Power Plant. The monitoring system and its possible coupling to the data and processing information system of the Laguna Verde Nuclear Power Plant are described. The signal processing methodology is presented along with the introduction of the application of the evolutionary matrix concept for determining the base signature of reactor equipment or component and the detection of off normal operation conditions.},

  abstract = {Core-barrel motion (CBM) surveillance and diagnostics, based on the amplitude of the peaks of the normalized auto power spectral densities (APSDs) of the ex-core neutron detectors, have been performed and continuously developed in Sweden and were applied for monitoring of the three PWR units, Ringhals 2 to 4. From 2005, multiple measurements were taken during each fuel cycle, and these revealed a periodic behavior of the 8-Hz peak of the beam-mode motion: the amplitude increases within the cycle and returns to a lower value at the beginning of the next cycle. The work reported in this paper aims to clarify the physical reason for this behavior. A combination of a mode separation method in the time domain and a nonlinear curve-fitting procedure of the frequency spectra revealed that two types of vibration phenomena contribute to the beam-mode peak. The lower frequency peak around 7 Hz in the ex-core detector APSDs corresponds to the CBM, whose amplitude does not change during the cycle. The higher frequency peak around 8 Hz arises from the individual vibrations of the fuel assemblies, and its amplitude increases monotonically during the cycle. This paper gives an account of the work that has been made to verify the above hypothesis.},

Based on the different symmetry properties of the vibration modes, a mode separation technique was developed to enhance the contributions from the different modes. Recent observations of wear at both the lower and upper core-barrel-support structures in the Ringhals PWRs indicated that vibration modes of the core barrel other than pendular (beam mode) and shell mode are likely to occur. A beam mode type movement alone is not able to explain such a wear, and therefore, it is fair to assume that the vibration mode in question is a small amplitude periodic tilting movement of the core barrel around a horizontal, diagonal pivot at the half height of the core. In this work, ex-core data taken in the Ringhals-4 PWR were analyzed in order to find evi- dence of such a tilting movement. First, cross spectra between various ex-core detectors were calculated and analyzed to locate the frequency range of the new vibrational mode. Then, a model based on symmetry considerations was derived in order to extract the sought mode from the spectra. The measurements were evaluated by the new mode enhancement technique. The results show that it is possible to enhance such a mode and find it in the spectra by properly combining the signals in the time domain.},

This surveillance is focused mainly on the pendular motion of the core barrel, which is known as the beam mode. The monitoring of the beam mode has suggested that its amplitude increases along the cycle and decreases after refuelling. In the last 5 years several measurements have been taken in order to understand this behaviour. Besides, a non-linear fitting procedure has been implemented in order to better distinguish the different components of vibration. By using this fitting procedure, two modes of vibration have been identified in the frequency range of the beam mode. Several results coming from the trend analysis performed during these years indicate that one of the modes is due to the core barrel motion itself and the other is due to the individual flow induced vibrations of the fuel elements. In this work, the latest results of this monitoring are presented.},

For the experiments, a high-precision linear motor axis is used to insert an oscillating perturbation acting at frequencies smaller than the lower bound of the plateau region of the ZPTF.

  abstract = {The present article presents the mechanical characterization of the fuel rods oscillator developed for the purposes of the COLIBRI experimental program in CROCUS. COLIBRI aims at investigating the radiation noise related to fuel vibrations. The main motivation is the increased amplitudes in the neutron noise distributions recorded in ex- and in-core detectors that have been observed in recent years in Siemens pre-Konvoi type of pressurized water reactors. Several potential explanations have been put forward, but no definitive conclusions could yet be drawn. Among others, changes in fuel assembly or pin vibration patterns, due to recent modifications of assembly structural designs, were pointed out as a possible cause. Computational dynamic tools are currently developed within the Horizon 2020 European project CORTEX, to help with understanding the additional noise amplitude. The COLIBRI program is used for their validation. An in-core device was designed, tested, and licensed between 2015 and 2019 for fuel rods oscillation in CROCUS, in successive steps from out-of-pile tests with dummy fuel rods to critical in-core tests. The characterization of its mechanical behavior is presented, in air and in water, and as a function of the load, for safety and experimental purposes. The device allows simultaneously oscillating up to 18 fuel rods. The maximum oscillation amplitude is 5 mm, while the maximum allowed frequency is 2 Hz, i.e. in the frequency range in which the induced neutron flux fluctuations are most pronounced in nuclear power plants.},

An important part of the CORTEX project deals with code development and validation. In this paper, a new methodology for the simulation of neutron noise has been formulated and implemented in the APOLLO3 code. In the first part of this paper, the experimental setup and the methodology for the experimental data analysis developed by CEA are presented. The experimental outcomes are reported in terms of Cross-Power Spectral Densities (CPSD) of detector responses. The results produced with CEA analysis are compared to those obtained by EPFL. The second part of the work presents the noise simulator based on an improved point-kinetics model employed in a fully heterogeneous 2D transport calculation including its theoretical derivation. The computed results, i.e. the temporal signals of the detector responses, are treated to recover the CPSDs to be compared to the experimental ones. In the third part of the work, the paper presents a series of interpretive exercises performed with the IPK noise model aiming at showing its simulation capabilities and at trying to address some of the discrepancies observed in the direct comparison. Beside the promising outcomes of the simulations, some work is still being done from the experimental and computational side for a better comprehension of the problem before the extension of the model to full 3D problems and industrial application.},

  abstract = {Low-frequency neutronic noise with magnitudes of up to ten percent of the reactor power have been observed in Konvoi-type PWR in Germany in the last years. Several attempts were made to identify the reasons for increased magnitudes of the neutronic fluctuations in comparison with pre-Konvoi reactors, and various hypotheses have been created to explain this effect. In this paper, results of noise simulations performed with use of the reactor dynamics code DYN3D are presented. Fluctuations of the coolant inlet temperature and mass flow rate were considered. Besides of un-correlated fluctuations, correlated temperature fluctuations were simulated. In a preliminary analysis with harmonic temperature oscillations, the importance of existing correlations between temperature fluctuations in the individual fuel assemblies was pointed out. In our analyses, the correlations between fluctuations in the individual fuel assemblies were obtained based on an experimentally validated coolant mixing model. However, the features of the neutronic noise found in the simulations do not correspond to the measurements. Obviously, more complex mechanisms than only temperature and/or mass flow fluctuations have to be considered. Simulated generic fluctuations of the local moderator density, that were introduced independently from thermal hydraulics, indicate that potentially deformations or vibrations of the fuel rod lattice or turbulent fluctuations of the coolant temperature and density inside the fuel rod bundles leading to variations of the local moderator content might be responsible for the observed neutronic noise. Therefore, advanced models coupling neutronics, thermal hydraulics, turbulence and mechanical modelling have to be developed.},

Telegrapher's equation is supposed to demonstrate a more realistic approximation for neutron transport phenomena, especially in comparison to the diffusion theory. The physics behind such equation implies that the signal propagation speed is finite, instead of the infinite as in the case of ordinary diffusion. This paper presents the theory and results of the development of a new method for calculation of the neutron noise using the telegrapher's equation as its basis. In order to investigate the differences and strengths of the new method against the diffusion based neutron noise, a comparison was done between the behaviors of two methods. The neutron noise based on SN transport considered as a precision measuring point. The Green's function technique was used to calculate the neutron noise based on telegrapher's and diffusion methods as well as the transport. The amplitude and phase of Green's function associated with the properties of the medium and frequency of the noise source were obtained and their behavior was compared to the results of the transport. It was observed, the differences in some cases might be considerable. The effective speed of propagation for the noise perturbations were evaluated accordingly, resulting in considerable deviations in some cases.},

This simulator calculates both the direct and the adjoint reactor transfer function between a stationary noise source and its induced neutron noise for any 2-dimensional heterogeneous critical system. The main advantage of this neutron noise simulator is that any realistic core can be modelled, since the simulator is designed to rely on a set of material constants corresponding to the actual reactor operating conditions. The calculations are performed in the 2-group diffusion approximation and in the frequency domain. The spatial discretisation is carried out with respect to the finite difference scheme. The noise source, expressed as an ``absorber of variable strength'' type, is defined directly from the fluctuations of the macroscopic cross-sections and can be spatially distributed over the core or concentrated in a few discrete nodes. If the noise source is a point-source, the simulator actually estimates the 2-dimensional 2-group discretised Green's function of the system. From the calculated Green's function, the neutron noise induced by a ``vibrating absorber'' type of noise source can also be determined. Different benchmark cases show that this neutron noise simulator works satisfactorily.},

On the other hand, in particle transport theory the relationship between the direct and adjoint Green's function has been discussed in detail, in which Mike Williams has had many seminal contributions. In this note we analyse the relationship between the direct Green's function and the dynamic adjoint in the spirit of Mike's work in neutron transport and radiation damage theory.

This method makes use of the application of a stationary perturbation to the system at a given frequency and extraction of the point-kinetic component of the system response. Even for strongly heterogeneous systems for which an analytical solution does not exist, the point-kinetic component follows, as a function of frequency, a simple analytical form. The comparison between the extracted point-kinetic component and its expected analytical form provides an opportunity to verify and validate neutron transport solvers. The proposed method is tested on two diffusion-based codes, one working in the time domain and the other working in the frequency domain. As long as the applied perturbation has a non-zero reactivity effect, it is demonstrated that the method can be successfully applied to verify and validate time- or frequency-dependent neutron transport solvers. Although the method is demonstrated in the present paper in a diffusion theory framework, higher order neutron transport methods could be verified based on the same principles.},

Among other things, the relative weight and the range of the local component is investigated. It is found that the strong neutronic coupling in an MSR, which was pointed out in the preceding paper, diminishes the role of the local component as compared to light water reactors.

This paper reports on the development as well as the test and application of the numerical tools employed. The code that was developed yields the space-dependence of the fluctuations of the neutron flux induced by fluctuating properties of the medium in the two-group diffusion approximation and in a two-dimensional representation of heterogeneous systems, for both critical systems and non-critical systems with an external source. Some applications of these tools to power reactor noise analysis are then described, including the unfolding of the parameters of the noise source from the~induced neutron noise, measured at a few discrete locations throughout the core. Other concrete applications concern the study of the space-dependence of the Decay Ratio in Boiling Water Reactors, the noise-based estimation of the Moderator Temperature Coefficient of reactivity in Pressurized Water Reactors, the modeling of the beam- and shell-mode core-barrel vibrations in Pressurized Water Reactors, and the investigation of the validity of the point-kinetic approximation in subcritical systems driven by an external source. In most of these applications, calculations performed using the code are compared with at-power plant measurements. Power reactor noise analysis applications of the above type, i.e. core monitoring without disturbing plant operation, is of particular interest in the framework of the extensive program of power uprates worldwide.},

The applicability of diffusion theory for different types and locations of the perturbation, as well as different frequencies, is assessed. Material data, i.e. nuclear cross-sections and kinetic parameters, representative of a Light Water Reactor (LWR) and of a Heavy Water Reactor (HWR), respectively, are used in this work. It is demonstrated that for practical situations in LWRs and HWRs, there is no significant advantage to use P1 theory since diffusion theory gives acceptable results. The largest deviations between the two formalisms are observed in regions of large gradients of the static neutron flux, such as close to the reflector interface and close to the perturbation. Such observations are in agreement with theoretical expectations. This study also indicates that neglecting the effect of cross-section perturbation on the diffusion coefficient gives a rather small impact on the solution. This allows drastically simplifying the determination of the neutron noise. When using numerical techniques for such a determination the memory requirements and computational effort can be significantly reduced.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the development, validation, and demonstration of an innovative neutronic tool. The novelty of the tool resides in its versatility, since many different systems can be investigated and different kinds of calculations can be performed. More precisely, both critical systems and subcritical systems with an external neutron source can be studied, and static and dynamic cases in the frequency domain (i.e. for stationary fluctuations) can be considered. In addition, the tool has the ability to determine the different eigenfunctions of any nuclear core. For each situation, the static neutron flux, the different eigenmodes and eigenvalues, the first-order neutron noise, and their adjoint functions are estimated, as well as the effective multiplication factor of the system. The main advantages of the tool, which is entirely MatLab based, lie with the robustness of the implemented numerical algorithms, its high portability between different computer platforms and operative systems, and finally its ease of use since no input deck writing is required. The present version of the tool, which is based on two-group diffusion theory, is mostly suited to investigate thermal systems. The definition of both the static and dynamic core configurations directly from the static macroscopic cross-sections and their fluctuations, respectively, makes the tool particularly well suited for research and education. Some of the many benchmark cases used to validate the tool are briefly reported. The static and dynamic capabilities of the tool are also demonstrated for the following configurations: a vibrating control rod, a perturbation traveling upwards with the core flow, and a high frequency localized perturbation. The tool is freely available on direct request to the author of the present paper.},

The neutron noise of power nuclear reactors deals with the fluctuations of the neutron flux that are induced by fluctuations or oscillations of the reactor properties, i.e. displacement of core components, temperature or density variations, etc. Since the appearance of these perturbations can be problematic for the operation of nuclear reactors, it is desirable to be able to analyze their possible effects. The comparison between the modelling of such perturbations and possible measurements also gives the possibility to determine the driving perturbation in an operating nuclear reactor. One modelling approach is to solve numerically the neutron noise diffusion equation.

  abstract = {The paper presents the development of a strategy for the fine-mesh full-core computation of neutron noise in nuclear reactors. Reactor neutron noise is related to fluctuations of the neutron flux induced by stationary perturbations of the properties of the system. Its monitoring and analysis can provide useful insights in the reactor operations. The model used in the work relies on the neutron diffusion approximation and requires the solution of both the criticality (eigenvalue) and neutron noise equations. A highresolution spatial discretization of the equations is important for an accurate evaluation of the neutron noise because of the strong gradients that may arise from the perturbations. Considering the size of a nuclear reactor, the application of a fine mesh generates large systems of equations which can be challenging to solve. Then, numerical methods that can provide efficient solutions for these kinds of problems using a reasonable computational effort, are investigated. In particular the power method accelerated with the Chebychev or JFNK-based techniques for the eigenvalue problem, and GMRES with the Symmetric Gauss-Seidel, ILU, SPAI preconditioners for the solution of linear systems, are evaluated with the computation of neutron noise in the case of localized perturbations in 1-D and 2-D simplified reactor cores and in a 3D realistic reactor core.},

The motivation comes from the fact that both static and dynamic perturbations act as non-isotropic sources in the P1 expansion of the static angular flux and the angular noise, respectively, and the neglection of these terms, which would allow the use of diffusion theory, is not obvious. In addition, the effect of noise sources that affect primarily the scattering cross section (diffusion coefficient) has not been the subject of a thorough investigation before. The P1 theory of static and dynamic perturbations is developed in this paper and the results show the corrections introduced by P1 theory. It is found that for cases when the fluctuation of the absorption cross section dominates, the quantitative difference between the diffusion and P1 theory results is negligible in general. For cases when the perturbation leads to the fluctuation of the scattering cross section only, such as in cases of density fluctuations in a heavy water moderator or even a small light water reactor, P1 theory needs to be used and the results differ markedly from the noise induced by an equivalent absorption cross section fluctuation in diffusion theory. Some concrete cases are investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively.},

For this purpose, the solver NOISE-SN is developed and used to simulate two neutron noise problems that are respectively derived from the two-dimensional systems described in the neutron transport simulation benchmarks C4V and C5G7. In the first problem based on the C4V system, NOISE-SN is compared to the diffusion-based simulator CORE SIM+. These results show that NOISE-SN and CORE SIM+ calculate similar spatial distributions of neutron noise, although significant differences can be found at the location of the perturbation and at locations with strong variations of material properties, where the discrete ordinates method is expected to be more accurate than diffusion theory. Then NOISE-SN calculations are performed to test different SN approximations, and the fictitious source method that may be applied to mitigate possible numerical artifacts, known as the ray effect. In the second problem based on the C5G7 system, the choice of a low order of discrete ordinates in NOISE-SN leads to unphysical values of the neutron noise because of the ray effect. The increase of the order of discrete ordinates or introducing a fictitious source in the equations to be solved alleviates the issue. The second option is shown to remove the ray effect without a high order of discrete ordinates and thus without too expensive calculations, even though the strength of the fictitious source needs to be tuned carefully to avoid very slow convergence rates.},

Deterministic noise solvers have tended to solve for and store this angular flux term in a preprocessing step. This can be a substantial memory burden as the angular flux is a function of space, energy, and angle. This can limit these solvers to smaller problems and can limit the obtainable angular resolution. This paper proposes solving the neutron noise equation and the standard eigenvalue neutron transport equation simultaneously, reducing the memory footprint of a noise solve while making frequency-domain method of characteristics solvers practical. This approach is demonstrated using the random ray method but is applicable to any sweep-based methods. Using the random ray method also has the advantage of exact geometry representation, no ray effects, and cheaper transport sweeps, all of which have been problematic. These advantages are illustrated on several noise problems.},

The origin of these effects within the derivation of the Sn discrete ordinates equations is shown, and the effects are related to the non-equivalence of the general geometry discrete ordinates equations and the corresponding spherical harmonics equations. Procedures are given for the definition of two-dimensional discrete ordinates equations that are equivalent to the spherical harmonics equations. Elimination of ray effects from the two-dimensional S2 equations by reduction to the diffusion theory equations is verified in a numerical example. Recipes for the elimination of ray effects are analyzed in the analytic solution of the infinite medium, isotropic line-source problem in the rectangular geometry, S2 approximation. Optimum magnitudes for corrective source terms are indicated by the analysis. It is concluded that ray effects may be eliminated by modification of the discrete ordinates formulation, but that the extra computational effort may be more expensive than the alternative of increasing the order of angular quadrature and that the presence of discretization effects may serve as an indicator of the adequacy of the angular quadrature used.},

There are considerable differences between Green's functions based on diffusion and transport, such as small dimensions, near edges, high heterogeneity medium and high-frequency source of perturbation. These differences are expected to significantly impact unfolding, reconstruction, and identification of the neutron noise source. Improvement in noise source unfolding methods is essential in terms of safety aspects and reactor performance enhancement. Since gaining the ability to monitor nuclear reactor based on noise diagnostics principle using few numbers of detectors is a challenging problem, more accurate methods of calculation of neutron noise can help reduce the detectors in number and sensitivity to location. This study revealed that inverse Green's function based on diffusion and transport is fundamentally different in concept. The inverse Green's function based on diffusion theory requires applying complicated reconstruction methods to gain more accurate results. This means that a large number of detectors must be used for noise source reconstruction. In contrast, in the case of inverse Green's function based on transport theory, each mesh's shape function is strongly correlated with the adjacent mesh. As a result, simple methods can be used to reconstruct the noise source. Therefore, the noise source can be identified and reconstructed with a smaller number of detectors in practical terms.},

In this work, different simulation models for the study of the influence of the mechanical vibrations of fuel assemblies on the neutron flux in the reactor core have been discussed. These methodologies employ the diffusion approximation, with or without a previous homogenization model, to simulate the neutron noise in the time or the frequency domain. The diffusion-based approach is expected to be less accurate in the vicinity of the vibrating fuel assemblies, but correct when considering distances larger than a few diffusion lengths away from the perturbation. All methodologies provide consistent results and can reproduce typical features of the neutron noise induced by mechanical vibrations of core components. First, FEMFFUSION can perform simulations in both the time and frequency domains. Second, CORE SIM~+~can be used to study various neutron noise scenarios in realistic three-dimensional reactor configurations. The third methodology is centred on using commercial codes as CASMO-5, SIMULATE-3 and SIMULATE-3K. This methodology allows time domain simulations of the neutron noise induced by different neutron noise sources in a nuclear reactor. Finally, a model for time-dependent geometry is implemented for the code system ATHLET/QUABOX-CUBBOX employing a cross-section-based approach for encoding water gap width variations at the reflector.},

  abstract = {To simulate the behaviour of a nuclear power reactor it is necessary to be able to integrate the time-dependent neutron diffusion equation inside the reactor core. Here the spatial discretization of this equation is done using a finite element method that permits h--p refinements for different geometries. This means that the accuracy of the solution can be improved refining the spatial mesh (h-refinement) and also increasing the degree of the polynomial expansions used in the finite element method (p-refinement). Transients involving the movement of the control rod banks have the problem known as the rod-cusping effect. Previous studies have usually approached the problem using a fixed mesh scheme defining averaged material properties. The present work proposes the use of a moving mesh scheme that uses spatial meshes that change with the movement of the control rods avoiding the necessity of using equivalent material cross sections for the partially inserted cells. The performance of the moving mesh scheme is tested studying one-dimensional and three-dimensional benchmark problems.},

  abstract = {In German KWU pressurized water reactors, the neutron flux is measured with in-core and the ex-core detectors. Investigating the signal fluctuations of these detectors at fixed burnup, periods of growing and periods of decreasing fluctuation amplitudes can be found, a phenomenon that is not entirely explained. Respecting the phenomenology of measured neutron noise data as well as of simulation results from the reactor-dynamics code DYN3D, the model hypothesis formulated here is a first attempt to couple low-frequency, collective fuel assembly deflections to power reactor noise: pressure fluctuations dynamically drive fuel assembly deflections, which alter the position of the common center of mass of all fuel assemblies; the center of mass fluctuations drive fluctuating changes of the reflector thickness and, thus, induce long-range dynamical effects on the neutron flux. As one detail, the proposed model states that a lowered lateral fuel assembly stiffness results in an increase of the neutron flux fluctuation amplitudes and vice versa. For testing this hypothesis, the model has been coupled to DYN3D. The signal analysis of the results obtained with the modified DYN3D indicates that the proposed model may explain the phenomenon of increasing and decreasing neutron flux fluctuation amplitudes. Steps for further modelling are proposed.},

  abstract = {Insufficiently explained magnitudes and patterns of flux fluctuation observed mainly in KWU PWRs are recently investigated by various European institutions. Among the numerical tools used to investigate the neutron flux fluctuations is the time-domain reactor dynamics code DYN3D. As DYN3D and comparable codes have not been developed with the primary intention to simulate low-amplitude neutron flux fluctuations, their applicability in this field has to be verified. In order to contribute to the verification of DYN3D for the simulation of neutron flux fluctuations, two special cases of perturbations of the neutron flux (a localized absorber of variable/oscillatory strength and a travelling oscillatory perturbation) are considered with DYN3D on the one hand and with the frequency-domain neutron noise tool CORE SIM as well as analytical frequency-domain approaches, respectively, on the other hand. The obtained results are compared with respect to the distributions of the amplitude and the phase of the induced neutron flux fluctuations. The comparisons are repeated with varied amplitudes and frequencies of the perturbation. The results agree well both qualitatively and quantitatively for each of the conducted calculations. The remaining deviations between the DYN3D results and the reference results exhibit a dependence on the perturbation magnitude, which is attributed to the neglect of higher-order terms (linear theory) of the perturbed quantities in the calculation of the reference solutions.},

  abstract = {A Monte Carlo algorithm to solve the transport equation of the neutron noise in the frequency domain has been developed to extend the conventional diffusion theory of the neutron noise to the transport theory. In this paper, the neutron noise is defined as the stationary fluctuation of the neutron flux around its mean value, and is induced by perturbations of the macroscopic cross sections. Since the transport equation of the neutron noise is a complex equation, a Monte Carlo technique for treating complex-valued weights that was recently proposed for neutron leakage-corrected calculations has been introduced to solve the complex equation. To cancel the positive and negative values of complex-valued weights, an algorithm that is similar to the power iteration method has been implemented. The newly-developed Monte Carlo algorithm is benchmarked to analytical solutions in an infinite homogeneous medium. The neutron noise spatial distributions have been obtained both with the newly-developed Monte Carlo method and the conventional diffusion method for an infinitely-long homogeneous cylinder. The results with the Monte Carlo method agree well with those of the diffusion method. However, near the noise source induced by a high frequency perturbation, significant differences are found between the diffusion method and Monte Carlo method. The newly-developed Monte Carlo algorithm is expected to contribute to the improvement of calculation accuracy of the neutron noise.},

The modified code is currently applicable to neutron noise calculations only within the plateau frequency range. The modified code is applied to the neutron noise calculations in a one-dimensional homogeneous multiplying system to verify its effectiveness through comparison with a two-energy group in-house research-purpose code. The neutron noise calculations for a benchmark model of a BWR core are performed using the modified MCNP code. The spatial and frequency characteristics of the neutron noise propagation in the BWR core are investigated through the calculations. The neutron noise near the noise source differs largely from the point kinetics because of the higher order mode effect.},

We develop a new Monte Carlo algorithm that solves the transport neutron noise equations in the frequency domain. The stochastic method presented here relies on a modified collision operator and does not need any weight cancellation technique. In this paper, both Monte Carlo methods are compared with deterministic methods (diffusion in a slab geometry and transport in a simplified rod model) for several noise frequencies and for isotropic and anisotropic noise sources. Our stochastic method shows better performances in the frequency region of interest and is easier to implement because it relies upon the conventional algorithm for fixed-source problems.},

The neutron noise equations in the frequency domain can be solved using Monte Carlo simulation codes, which are capable of obtaining reference solutions involving almost no approximations but are hindered by severe issues affecting the statistical convergence: The simultaneous presence of positive and negative particles, which is required by the nature of the complex noise equations, leads to catastrophically large variance in the tallies. In this work, we consider the important case of neutron noise problems induced by mechanical vibrations. First, we derive a new exact sampling strategy for the noise source. Then, building upon our previous findings in other contexts, we show that weight cancellation methods can be highly beneficial in dealing with the presence of negative weights, enabling extremely large gains in the figure of merit. We successfully demonstrate our results on a benchmark configuration consisting of a fuel assembly with a vibrating pin, and we discuss possible pathways for further improvements.},

  abstract = {Capitalizing on some earlier work, this paper presents a novel Monte Carlo-based approach that allows estimating the neutron noise induced by stationary perturbations of macroscopic cross-sections in the frequency domain. This method relies on the prior computation using Monte Carlo of modified Green's functions associated to the real part of the dynamic macroscopic cross-sections, mimicking equivalent subcritical problems driven by external neutron sources. Once such modified Green's functions are estimated, the neutron noise induced by any type of perturbations can be recovered, by solving a linear algebra problem accounting for the interdependence between the real and imaginary parts of the governing balance equations. The newly derived method was demonstrated on a large homogeneous test system and on a small heterogeneous test system to provide results comparable to a diffusionbased solver specifically developed for neutron noise applications. The new method requires the specification by the user of the real part of the Fourier transform of the macroscopic crosssections. This is accomplished using ACE-formatted cross-section files defined by the user. Beyond this input data preparation, no change to the Monte Carlo source code is necessary. This represents the main advantage of the proposed method as compared to similar efforts requiring extensive modifications to the Monte Carlo source code.},
